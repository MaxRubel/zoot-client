# Welcome to Zoot!

Zoot is my experiment wth Web-RTC peer to peer connections.  I used Web-RTCs to make a small video video conferencing app where users can join different public rooms and automatically connect with each other using the camera and audio streams captured through the web-browser.  There is a websocket signalling server written in Go in my repos folder as well.

Check it out here!
